Installation/Usage:
*******************
As the package has not been published on PyPi yet, it CANNOT be install using pip.

For now, the suggested method is to put the file `simpleble.py` in the same directory as your source files and call ``from simpleble import SimpleBleClient, SimpleBleDevice``.

``bluepy`` must also be installed and imported as shown in the example below.
For instructions about how to install, as well as the full documentation of, ``bluepy`` please refer `here <https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy/>`_

Search for device, connect and read characteristic

    """This example demonstrates a simple BLE client that scans for devices,
    connects to a device (GATT server) of choice and continuously reads a characteristic on that device.

    The GATT Server in this example runs on an ESP32 with Arduino. For the
    exact script used for this example see `here <https://github.com/nkolban/ESP32_BLE_Arduino/blob/6bad7b42a96f0aa493323ef4821a8efb0e8815f2/examples/BLE_notify/BLE_notify.ino/>`_
